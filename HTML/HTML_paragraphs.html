    <body>
        <p>When I was younger, I broke both of my arms. I was in third grade. I was sitting on a branch of a tree not too far off the ground. When I jumped off the branch, my back pocket caught on the tree and I landed on a log, arms first. It snapped all 4 bones in my arms.</p>
        <p>I had one green cast and one blue one. My friends all signed them and I felt so cool! At recess, I would use my cast to hit the baseball instead of the baseball bat. Writing was difficult though because I had a hard time holding a pencil. My brother was kind and helped me write out my homework when I gave him the answers.</p>

        <p>oh give me a home where the buffalo roam!</p>
        <p>Where deer and the the antelope play!</p>
        <p>Where seldom is heard a discouraging word and the skies are not cloudy all day!</p>
