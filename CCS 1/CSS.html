      Once upon a time there was a girl named Goldilocks who was wandering about in the woods. -->

    <!-- <p>
        Eventually she came upon a house. Nobody was home so she went inside.
    </p> --> -->
    <!-- Fairytale Comment #3: -->
    <!-- <p>
        Three bowls of porridge sat on the table. She tried the first--too hot! She tried the second--too cold! She tried the third--just right. She ate the whole bowl.
    </p> -->
    <!-- Fairytale Comment #4: -->
    <!-- <p>
        She was tired, so she went to a bedroom with 3 beds. She tried the first bed--too hard! She tried the second--too soft! She tried the third--just right. She fell asleep.
